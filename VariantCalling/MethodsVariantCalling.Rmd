## Overview

This variant calling workflow in bash scripting is used. 

1. getGenomes.sh- In this bash script, the wget function is used to obtain a copy of the fast file and then gunzip is used to unpack or unzip the file which when done will extract the GRCh38 reference genome. [@Li]

2. getReads. sh- This bash script is used for downloading the fast reads. For this purpose, the SRA Toolkit is used, specifically the fast-dump function which dumps/downloads the fastq file and then split the files since the layout of the is paired. So after the split files flag is used, two fastq files are obtained. [@Mckenna]

3. trimReads.sh- This bash script employs Trimmomatic which is a trimming tool employing Java for trimming Illumina reads. It quality trims the reads and splits it into paired and unpaired reads. [@Chen]

4. indexGenome.sh- In the next step, indexGenome.sh uses BWA or the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner to create a BWT index of the reference genome obtained from getGenome.sh A fai is used to create a fasta index, since some NGS tools require fasta index files [@Bolger]

5. alignReads.sh- This bash script uses the bwa mem algorithm which performs local alignment. In this script, the RG or the read groups identifiers are also tagged. If paired end files are used, the output SAM files can be combined using Picard's MergeSamFiles to bind them into one and carry further analyses. [@Valrie]

6. sortSam.sh- The output SAM file from bwa mem is then sorted using sort flag from Samtools. It arranges all the entries in a SAM file in an order (by leftmost coordinates) Ultimately, a BAM or a binary alignment map which is a compressed file format of SAM is created using Samtools. Other flags used in the script signify the number of threads to be used and the memory assigned to these threads. [@Kalinin]

7. indexReads.sh- The sorted BAM files are further indexed using and a BAM index or a .bai file is produced as an output. 

8. runDeepVariant.sh- This script allows us to run DeepVariant and carry out variant calling which produces a VCF file in the end enlisting the variants. [@Lisa]
